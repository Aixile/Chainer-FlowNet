Chainer-FlowNet
-------------------------------

Chainer adaptation of FlowNet


[FlowNet: Learning Optical Flow with Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06852)

You can download the pretrained model from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx_f0Ep2RFzhWld6N0lDVmdfVFU/view?usp=sharing). This model is directly adapted from [author's pretrained model](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/resources/software.php).

**Only FlowNetS is available yet.**

Note that you need to resize the input/output images manually, and the input images should be scaled to [0, 1].
